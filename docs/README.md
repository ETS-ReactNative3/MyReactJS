## notes
A component takes in parameters, called props (short for “properties”), and returns a hierarchy of views to display via the render method.

To "remember" things, components use state.

In JavaScript classes, you need to always call super when defining the constructor of a subclass. All React component classes that have a constructor should start with a super(props) call.

In React, function components are a simpler way to write components that only contain a render method and don’t have their own state. Instead of defining a class which extends React.Component, we can write a function that takes props as input and returns what should be rendered. Function components are less tedious to write than classes, and many components can be expressed this way.
